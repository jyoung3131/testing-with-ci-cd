# it makes sense to run unit test CI on push
# but there are many triggers available: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows
# notable options are:
# "pull_request" might be a better option than push for heavy duty integration testing that requires actions such as spinning up servers or running database migrations
# "workflow_dispatch" facilitates manual invocation
# "schedule" if you feel like the workflow requires a cron schedule

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - 'main'
#    paths:
#      - '**.py'

jobs:
  test: # <-- this job name is totally up to you
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest # <-- usually ubuntu-latest, windows-latest, or macos-latest
    strategy:
      matrix: # <-- indicates we want to run this test job in a parametrized fashion, in this case specifying multiple Python versions
        python-version: ["3.9", "3.10", "3.11", "3.12"]

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4 # <-- every job runs on a clean runner, so you almost always start a job by checking out the code

      - name: Set up Python ${{ matrix.python-version }}
        uses: actions/setup-python@v5 # <-- this is a GitHub Marketplace action: https://github.com/actions/setup-python
        # GitHub Marketplace: https://github.com/marketplace - Always keep an eye on the versions and keep them updated, i.e. that "@v5" here or "@v4" on the checkout action above
        with:
          python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}

      - name: Display Python version
        run: python -c "import sys; print(sys.version)"
